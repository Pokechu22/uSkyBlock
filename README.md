# uSkyBlock

A decompilation of the uSkyBlock bukkit plugin (version 1.0.8), origionally made by Talabrek.

This decompilation does not compile.  That's not important - all it is intended for is to be a reference copy.  If you do wish to make it compile, you'll need to remove the decompilation comments - the `\uSkyBlock.jar` portion is treated as invalid unicode (despite the fact that it is in a comment) and java does not like it.  

This was decompiled using [Jdec](http://jdec.sourceforge.net/) version 2.0.
